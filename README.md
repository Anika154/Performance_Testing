# Performance_Testing

## Introduction: 
Pioneer Alpha website has been taken for performance testing in JMeter.

## Elements for a complete JMeter flow:
- Test Plan Creation
- Thread Group
- Sampler
- Listener

## Test Plan Creation:
Test Plan is where we add elements required for the JMeter test. It stores all the elements, like ThreadGroup, Timers etc., and their corresponding settings required to run your desired tests.
## Thread Group:
Thread Group is a collection of Threads/Users. The controls for a thread group allow you to Set the number of threads for each group.
## Samplers:
The user sends HTTP/HTTPS, FTP, and JDBC requests to an FTP server, a web server, and a database, which is known as a sampler.
